# Stardust Extinction

[![Build](https://github.com/KSmith8888/stardust-extinction/actions/workflows/main-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KSmith8888/stardust-extinction/actions/workflows/main-build.yml)

A space-themed browser game made with TypeScript, playable on both desktop and mobile. The user controls a spaceship which fires lasers as enemy ships continuously enter the screen. Each level includes varied enemy types with unique behavior and a boss stage. The menu system includes settings for controls, audio, difficulty and other gameplay options. The game is fully playable with either keyboard or mouse and
controls can be mapped to different keys.
